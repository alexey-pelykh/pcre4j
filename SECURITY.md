# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in PCRE4J, please report it through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/alexey-pelykh/pcre4j/security/advisories/new). This ensures the issue is handled confidentially.

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

## Scope

This security policy covers the **PCRE4J binding layer** — the Java code in this repository that interfaces with the PCRE2 native library.

Security issues in the **PCRE2 native library itself** should be reported to the [PCRE2 upstream project](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2).

## Response

We aim to acknowledge security reports within 72 hours and provide a timeline for a fix. Critical vulnerabilities will be prioritized for patching.
